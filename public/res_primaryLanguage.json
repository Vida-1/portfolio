      "description": "Though I already had an established history of feeding and caring for strays, my adventures in organized canine rescue started as the result of a lost bet with a friend. Having been out-scored on a quiz I had to volunteer for a shift working with rescued bully breeds. Well, I fell in love with it and went on to spend years working with bullies, Golden Retrievers and several other breeds and mixes falling in love with each furry face along the way. In the intervening years my own pack of furkids grew as well.",

I started out proctoring/tutoring two nephews and a niece for the 2020-2021 school year and it went so well that I became the full-time teacher for the two boys for the 2021-2022 school year. Unfortunately, due to logistics issues my niece wasn't in attendence this past year but will be returning along with her little sister for 2022-2023.",
